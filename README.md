This project was created using Flask Python backend in conjunction with tomorrow.io API weather data.  The website is made to be dynamic in scaling when screen sizes are reduced and works on mobile devices as well.  Weather information is updated hourly due to free tier rate limiting requirements from the tomorrow.io website.  I'm open to all feedback and have created a contact me page integrated into the website for suggestions and tips as well as any other comments
